      <h2>About JustWeather</h2>
<p>JustWeather is a lightweight weather application designed to deliver accurate, reliable, and flexible weather information and forecasts. It was developed as a personal project by <a href="https://voks2.github.io/">Vojin Mitrović.</a></p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Data:</strong> Integrates with the OpenWeather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for any selected location.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Location Detection:</strong> Enables weather updates for the user’s current location, based on geolocation permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Location Search:</strong> Utilizes the HERE API to allow manual entry of locations for tailored weather forecasts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>JustWeather was created to demonstrate web development expertise and explore the integration of AI in coding workflows. While AI tools were used during development, all functionalities have been manually tested and refined to ensure quality and reliability.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The development of the JustWeather app is guided by comprehensive product documentation, including the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R28uh723AeXVtSfDVMVHuc2Q2Xk3j2Q3NJvNNZ4hGYo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.slobgfl9o45k" target="_blank">Product Requirements Document (PRD)</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pE_FZmFcAMTiupm9SA4uGwTtK5RfFEnx3IL6beM4jiw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.slobgfl9o45k" target="_blank">Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</a>, and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XKf7eJStkhSnAt1dVS0kjPfr64NlQikNU3Cn394mLQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">Sprint Plan with a detailed task sheet</a>. </p>
  
<p>The app has undergone two cycles of testing: first in the staging environment and then in the production environment. The testing process is recorded in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJR5xJgqfyCXHiIzMsuQoXYiupaIbbxvLq4ErTFxlt8/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">Traceability Matrix and Test Cases Sheet</a> to ensure thorough coverage and accountability. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SFQBFl0CEyZiDNILNxbumjBGPWGvr6bO" target="_blank">Two bugs</a> were identified during the initial test run, both of which were resolved and verified in the subsequent production environment test run.</p>
