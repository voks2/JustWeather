      <p>Welcome to Pulseweather, a lightweight weather app designed to provide current weather information and forecasts with simplicity and accuracy. This app is a personal project created to showcase my web development and AI-assisted programming skills.</p>
      
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-Time Weather Data: Powered by the OpenWeather API, JustWeather fetches reliable and up-to-date weather information.</li>
        <li>Location Management: Integrated with the HERE API, the app enables efficient location detection and management.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Purpose of JustWeather</h2>
      <p>This app is part of my portfolio and serves as a practice tool for improving my proficiency in web development and leveraging AI for coding assistance. While AI tools have been used to generate parts of the code, all functionalities have been thoroughly tested and refined manually, ensuring the final product is entirely human-verified.</p>
      
      <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate my process-oriented approach to development, I’ve prepared a comprehensive set of documents for this app. These include: </p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Product Requirements Document (PRD)</li>
        <li>Product Specification Document (SRS)</li>
        <li>Testing Traceability Matrix</li>
        <li>Bug Reports</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find all this documentation here. It offers a detailed view of the planning, design, and testing process for JustWeather.</p>
      <p>Thank you for exploring JustWeather!</p>
